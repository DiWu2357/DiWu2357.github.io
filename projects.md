#### Quantamental Deep Learning and Machine Learning, Hong Kong Polytechnic University
•	Researched on a quant-fundamental project which aimed to compare the earnings estimate performances between machine learning and deep learning models using fundamental financial data.

•	Developed two earnings estimate models using Light Gradient Boosting Machine and GRU RNN algorithms in Python.

•	Utilized algorithms including Grid Search, Random Search and Sequential Model-based Search to optimize the hyperparameters for both models.

•	Compared two model performances by implementing 20 years of back-testing.
